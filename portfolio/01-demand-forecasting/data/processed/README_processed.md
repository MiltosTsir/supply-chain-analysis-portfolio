# Processed Data â€“ Demand Forecasting

This folder will contain processed datasets derived from the raw data (`data/raw/`).  
Processed data is used in notebooks and models after cleaning and transformation.

## Planned Contents

- **cleaned_sales.csv**  
  Dataset after removing anomalies, filling missing values, and resampling time series.

- **feature_engineered.csv**  
  Dataset enriched with extra features (e.g., moving averages, lags, seasonality indicators).

- **train_test_splits/**  
  Subfolder with training and testing splits for reproducibility of experiments.

## Notes
- Processed data files should not be edited manually.  
- Each processed dataset will be generated by scripts in the `src/` folder or by notebooks.  
- Large files may be excluded from GitHub and stored externally (with references in this README).
