# Source Code â€“ Demand Forecasting

This folder will contain Python source code and helper functions for the **Demand Forecasting** project.

---

## Planned Contents

- **data_preprocessing.py**  
  Functions to clean and transform raw data (handle missing values, resample time series, feature engineering).

- **forecasting_models.py**  
  Functions to fit and evaluate forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, ML-based).

- **evaluation.py**  
  Functions to calculate evaluation metrics (MAPE, MAE, RMSE) for model performance comparison.

---

## Notes
- Each `.py` file should include modular, reusable functions.  
- Code from this folder can be imported into notebooks for cleaner analysis.  
- Unit tests may be added later in a separate `tests/` folder.
